/**
 * Allows selection of parser type for new new JsonSlurper.
 * <p />
 * To enable the INDEX_OVERLAY parser do this:
 *
 * <code><pre>
 *             parser = new JsonSlurper().setType( JsonParserType.INDEX_OVERLAY );
 * </pre></code>
 *
 * INDEX_OVERLAY should be your parser of choice.
 * <p />
 * CHAR_BUFFER is the parser of choice due to element of least surprise and need to
 * mimic existing Slurper behavior as much as possible.
 * <p />
 * Use CHARACTER_SOURCE for large file parsing.
 * <p />
 * Use LAX if you want to enable relaxed JSON parsing, i.e., allow comments, no quote strings, etc.
 * <p />
 * Use CHAR_BUFFER for a non-fancy but super fast parser.
 *
 * <p>
 *     Parser speed in order: INDEX_OVERLAY, LAX, CHAR_BUFFER, CHARACTER_SOURCE.
 * </p>
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * <p />
 *
 * <p>
 *     Use LAX for config files as it allows comments.
 *     Use INDEX_OVERLAY for REST calls, WebSocket messages, AJAX, inter process communication, etc.
 *     Use CHAR_BUFFER if eager parsing of ints, dates, longs, are appealing.
 *     Use CHARACTER_SOURCE if you are dealing with large JSON files over 2MB.
 *     INDEX_OVERLAY is highly tuned for object deserialization from JSON.

     * Lazy Chop dices up the buffer when a list get or map get is called so if an GPath expression or

     * You do not need chop or lazy chop if you are not putting the map into a long term cache.
