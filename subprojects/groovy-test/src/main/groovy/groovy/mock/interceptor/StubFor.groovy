/**
 * StubFor supports (typically unit) testing of classes in isolation by allowing
 * a loosely-ordered expectation of the behavior of collaborators to be defined.
 *
 * A typical test scenario involves a class under test (CUT) and one or more
 * collaborators. In such a scenario it is often desirable to just test the
 * business logic of the CUT. One strategy for doing that is to replace
 * the collaborator instances with simplified stub objects to help isolate out
 * the logic in the CUT. StubFor allows such stubs to be created using
 * meta-programming. The desired behavior of collaborators is defined as a
 * behavior specification. The behavior can be checked by the user using verify().
 * With StubFor, a stub's expectation is sequence independent and use of verify()
 * is left to the user.
 *
 * Typical usage is as follows:
 * <pre>
 * import groovy.mock.interceptor.StubFor
 *
 * class Person {
 *   String first, last
 * }
 *
 * class Family {
 *   Person mother, father
 *   def nameOfFather() { "$father.first $father.last" }
 * }
 *
 * def stub = new StubFor(Person)
 * stub.demand.with {
 *   getLast{ 'name' }
 *   getFirst{ 'dummy' }
 * }
 * stub.use {
 *   def john = new Person(first:'John', last:'Smith')
 *   def f = new Family(father:john)
 *   assert f.nameOfFather() == 'dummy name'
 * }
 * stub.expect.verify()
 * </pre>
 * Here, <code>Family</code> is our class under test and <code>Person</code> is the collaborator.
 * We are using normal Groovy property semantics here; hence the statement
 * <code>father.first</code> causes a call to <code>father.getFirst()</code> to occur.
 *
 * For a complete list of features, see: {@link MockFor}.
