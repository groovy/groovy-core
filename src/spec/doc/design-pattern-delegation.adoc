= Delegation Pattern
:toc:

The http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegation_pattern[Delegation Pattern] is a technique where an object's behavior (public methods) is implemented by delegating responsibility to one or more associated objects.

Groovy allows the traditional style of applying the delegation pattern, e.g. see <<_replace_inheritance_with_delegation,Replace Inheritance with Delegation>>.

== Implement Delegation Pattern using ExpandoMetaClass

The http://groovy.codehaus.org/ExpandoMetaClass[ExpandoMetaClass] allows usage of this pattern to be encapsulated in a library. This allows Groovy to emulate similar libraries available for the Ruby language.

Consider the following library class:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/DesignPatternsTest.groovy[tags=delegation_delegator,indent=0]
----

With this in your classpath, you can now apply the delegation pattern dynamically as shown in the following examples. First, consider we have the following classes:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/DesignPatternsTest.groovy[tags=delegation_classes,indent=0]
----

We can now use the __delegator__ to automatically borrow methods from the __lender__ object to extend the __Person__ class. We can borrow the methods as is or with a rename:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/DesignPatternsTest.groovy[tags=delegation_usage,indent=0]
----

The first line above, adds the __borrowFor__ method to the __Person__ class by delegating to the __lender__ object. The second line adds a __getMoney__ method to the __Person__ class by delegating to the __lender__ object's __borrowAmount__ method.

Alternatively, we could borrow multiple methods like this:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/DesignPatternsTest.groovy[tags=delegation_usage2,indent=0]
----

Which adds these two methods to the __Person__ class.

Or if we want all the methods, like this:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/DesignPatternsTest.groovy[tags=delegation_usage3,indent=0]
----

Which will make all the methods in the delegate object available in the __Person__ class.

Alternatively, we can use a map notation to rename multiple methods:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/DesignPatternsTest.groovy[tags=delegation_usage4,indent=0]
----

== Implement Delegation Pattern using @Delegate annotation

Since version 1.6 you can use the built-in delegation mechanism which is based on AST transformation.

This make delegation even easier:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/DesignPatternsTest.groovy[tags=delegation_annotation,indent=0]
