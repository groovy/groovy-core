= Differences with Java

Groovy tries to be as natural as possible for Java developers. We’ve
tried to follow the principle of least surprise when designing Groovy,
particularly for developers learning Groovy who’ve come from a Java
background.

Here we list all the major differences between Java and Groovy.

== Default imports

All these packages and classes are imported by default, i.e. you do not
have to use an explicit `import` statement to use them:

* java.io.*
* java.lang.*
* java.math.BigDecimal
* java.math.BigInteger
* java.net.*
* java.util.*
* groovy.lang.*
* groovy.util.*

== Multi-methods (TBD)
== Array initializers (TBD)
== Package scope visibility (TBD)
== ARM blocks (TBD)
== Inner class instantiation (TBD)
