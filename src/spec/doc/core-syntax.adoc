This chapter covers the syntax of the Groovy programming language.
The grammar of the language derives from the Java grammar,
but enhances it with specific constructs for Groovy, and allows certain simplifications.

== Comments

=== Single line comment

Single line comments start with +//+ and can be found at any position in the line.
The characters following +//+, till the end of the line, are considered part of the comment.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=single_line_comment,indent=0]
----

=== Multiline comment

A multiline comment starts with +/\*+ and can be found at any position in the line.
The characters following +/*+ will be considered part of the comment, including new line characters,
up to the first +*/+ closing the comment.
Multiline comments can thus be put at the end of a statement, or even inside a statement.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=multiline_comment,indent=0]
----

=== GroovyDoc comment

Similarly to multiline comments, GroovyDoc comments are multiline, but start with +/\**+ and end with +\*/+.
Lines following the first GroovyDoc comment line can optionally start with a star +\*+.
Those comments are associated with:

* type definitions (classes, interfaces, enums, annotations),
* fields and properties definitions
* methods definitions

Although the compiler will not complain about JavaDoc comments not being associated with the above language elements,
you should prepend those constructs with the comment right before it.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=groovydoc_comment,indent=0]
----

GroovyDoc follows the same conventions as Java's own JavaDoc.
So you'll be able to use the same tags as with JavaDoc.

=== Shebang line

Beside the single line comment, there is a special line comment, often called the _shebang_ line understood by UNIX systems
which allows scripts to be run directly from the command-line, provided you have installed the Groovy distribution
and the +groovy+ command is available on the +PATH+.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=shebang_comment_line,indent=0]
----

NOTE: The +#+ character must be the first character of the file. Any indentation would yield a compilation error.

== Keywords

The following list represents all the keywords of the Groovy language:

[cols="1,1,1,1"]
.Keywords
|===
|as
|assert
|break
|case

|catch
|class
|const
|continue

|def
|default
|do
|else

|enum
|extends
|false
|finally

|for
|goto
|if
|implements

|import
|in
|instanceof
|interface

|new
|null
|package
|return

|super
|switch
|this
|throw

|throws
|true
|try
|while

== Identifiers

=== Normal identifiers

Identifiers start with a letter, a dollar or an underscore.
They cannot start with a number.

A letter can be in the following ranges:

* 'a' to 'z' (lowercase ascii letter)
* 'A' to 'Z' (uppercase ascii letter)
* '\u00C0' to '\u00D6'
* '\u00D8' to '\u00F6'
* '\u00F8' to '\u00FF'
* '\u0100' to '\uFFFE'

Then following characters can contain letters and numbers.

Here are a few examples of valid identifiers (here, variable names):

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=valid_identifiers,indent=0]
----

But the following ones are invalid identifiers:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=invalid_identifiers,indent=0]
----

All keywords are also valid identifiers when following a dot:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=keywords_valid_id_after_dot,indent=0]
----

=== Quoted identifiers

Quoted identifiers appear after the dot of a dotted expression.
For instance, the +name+ part of the +person.name+ expression can be quoted with +person."name"+ or +person.'name'+.
This is particularly interesting when certain identifiers contain illegal characters that are forbidden by the Java Language Specification,
but which are allowed by Groovy when quoted. For example, characters like a dash, a space, an exclamation mark, etc.



== Strings

=== Single quoted string
=== Double quoted string
=== Triple single quoted string
=== Triple double quoted string
=== Slashy string
=== Dollar slashy string

== Numbers

=== Integer literal



=== Floating point literal



NOTE: Decimal numbers can't be represented using a binary, octal or hexadecimal representation.

=== Binary literal

In Java 6 and before, as well as in Groovy, numbers could be represented in decimal, octal and hexadecimal bases, and with Java 7 and Groovy 2, you can use a binary notation with the ++0b++ prefix:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=binary_literal_example,indent=0]
----

=== Octal literal

Octal numbers are specified in the typical format of ++0++ followed by octal digits.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=octal_literal_example,indent=0]
----

=== Hexadecimal literal

Hexadecimal numbers are specified in the typical format of ++0x++ followed by hex digits.

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=hexadecimal_literal_example,indent=0]
----

=== Underscore in literal

When writing long literal numbers, it’s harder on the eye to figure out how some numbers are grouped together, for example with groups of thousands, of words, etc. By allowing you to place underscore in number literals, it’s easier to spot those groups:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=underscore_in_number_example,indent=0]
----

=== Number type suffixes

We can force an number (including binary, octals and hexadecimals) to have a specific type by giving a suffix (see table bellow), either uppercase or lowercase.

[cols="1,2" options="header"]
|====
|Type
|Suffix

|BigInteger
|G

|Long
|L

|Integer
|I

|BigDecimal
|G

|Double
|D

|Float
|F
|====

Examples:

== Booleans

Boolean is a special data type that is used to represent truth values: ++true++ and ++false++.
Use this data type for simple flags that track true/false <<_conditional_operators,conditions>>.

Boolean values can be stored in variables, just like any other data type:

[source,groovy]
----
include::../test/SyntaxTest.groovy[tags=variable_store_boolean_value,indent=0]
----

++true++ and ++false++ are the only two primitive boolean values.
But more complex boolean expressions can be represented using <<_bitwise_and_logical_operators,logical operators>>.
In addition, Groovy has <<_the_groovy_truth,special rules>> (often referred to as _Groovy Truth_) for coercing non-boolean objects to a boolean value.

== Arrays

== Lists

== Maps

=== String keys
=== Parenthesized keys
