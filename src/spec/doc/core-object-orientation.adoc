= Object orientation

This chapter covers the object orientation of the Groovy programming language.

== Types (TBD)

=== Primitive types (TBD)

=== Class

Groovy classes are very similar to Java classes, being compatible to those ones at JVM level. They may have methods and fields/properties, which can have the same modifiers (public, protected, private, static, etc) as Java classes.

Here are key aspects of Groovy classes, that are different from their Java counterparts:

 * Public fields are turned into properties automatically, which results in less verbose code, whithout so many getter and setter methods. More on this aspect will be covered in the Section "Fields and properties".
 * Their declarations and any property or method without an access modifier are public.
 * Classes do not need to have the same name of the files where they are defined.
 * One file may contain one or more classes (but if a file contains no classes, it is considered a script).

The following code presents an example class.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=class_definition,indent=0]
----
<1> class beginning, with the name `Person`
<2> string field and property named `name`
<3> method definition


==== Normal class

Normal classes refer to classes which are top level and concrete. This means they can be instantiated whithout restrictions from any other classes or scripts. This way, they can only be public (even though the `public` keyword may be supressed). Classes are instantiated by calling their constructors, using the `new` keywork, as in the following snippet.

[source,groovy]

include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=class_instantiation,indent=0]
----


==== Inner class

Inner classes are defined within another classes. The enclosing class can use the inner class as usual. On the other side, a inner class can access members of its enclosing class, even if they are private. Classes other than the enclosing class are not allowed to access inner classes. Here is an example:

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=inner_class,indent=0]
----
<1> the inner class is instantiated and its method gets called
<2> inner class definition, inside its enclosing class
<3> even being private, a field of the enclosing class is accessed by the inner class

There are some reasons for using inner classes:

 * They increase encapsulation by hiding the inner class from other classes, which do not need to know about it. This also leads to cleaner packages and workspaces.
 * They provide a good organization, by grouping classes that are used by only one class.
 * They lead to more mantainable codes, since inner classes are near the classes that use them.

In several cases, inner classes are implementation of interfaces whose methods are needed by the outer class. The code below illustrates this with the usage of threads, which are very common.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=inner_class2,indent=0]
----

Note that the class `Inner2` is defined whith the only purpose of providing an implementation of the method `run` to class `Outer2`. Anonymous inner classes help to eliminate verbosity in this case.


===== Anonymous inner class

The last example of inner class can be simplified with an anonymous inner class. The same functionality can be achieved with the following code.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=anonymous_inner_class,indent=0]
----
<1> comparing with the last example of previous section, the `new Inner2()` was replaced by `new Runnable()` along with all its implementation
<2> the method `start` is invoked normally

Thus, there was no need to define a new class to be used just once.


==== Abstract class

Abstract classes represent generic concepts, thus, they cannot be instantiated, being created to be subclassed. Their members incluide fields/properties and abstract or concrete methods. Abstract methods do not have implementation, and must be implemented by concrete subclasses.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=abstract_class,indent=0]
----
<1> abstract classes must be declared with `abstract` keyword
<2> abstract methods must also be declared with `abstract` keyword

Abstract classes are commonly compared to interfaces. But there are at least two important differences of choosing one or another. First, while abstract classes may contain fields/properties and concrete methods, interfaces may contain only abstract methods (method signatures). Moreover, one class can implement several interfaces, whereas it can extend just one class, abstract or not. 

=== Interface (TBD)

=== Annotation (TBD)

==== Closure annotation parameters (TBD)
==== Meta-annotations (TBD)
==== Annotation placement (TBD)

=== Constructors

Constructors are special methods used to initialize an object with a specific state. As in normal methods, it is possible for a class to declare more than one constructor. In Groovy there are two ways to invoke constructors: with positional parameters or named parameters. The former one is like we invoke Java constructors, while the second way allows one to specify the parameter names when invonking the constructor.

==== Positional argument constructor

To create an object by using positional argument constructors, the respective class needs to declare each of the constructors it allows being called. A side effect of this is that, once at least one constructor is declared, the class can only be instatiated by getting one of its constructors called. It is worth noting that, in this case, there is no way to create the class with named parameters.

There is three forms of using a declared constructor. The first one is the normal Java way, with the `new` keyword. The others rely on coercion of lists into the desired types. In this case, it is possible to coerce with the `as` keyword and by statically typing the variable.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=constructor_positional_parameters,indent=0]
----
<1> Constructor declaration
<2> Constructor invocation, classic Java way
<3> Constructor usage, using coercion with `as` keyword
<4> Constructor usage, using coercion in assignment


==== Named argument constructor

If no constructor is declared, it is possible to create objects by passing parameters in the form of a map (property/value pairs). This can be in handy in cases where one wants to allow several combinations of parameters. Otherwise, by using traditional positional parameters it would be necessary to declare all possible constructors.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/ClassTest.groovy[tags=constructor_named_parameters,indent=0]
----
<1> No constructor declared
<2> No parameters given in the instantiation
<3> `name` parameter given in the instantiation
<4> `age` parameter given in the instantiation
<5> `name` and `age` parameters given in the instantiation

It is important to highlight, however, that this approach gives more power to the constructor caller, while imposes a major responsibility to it. Thus, if a restriction is needed, one can just declare one or more construtors, and the instantiation by named parameters will no longer be available.


=== Methods

Groovy methods are quite similar to other languages. Some peculiarities will be shown in the next subsections. 

==== Method definition

A method is defined with a return type or with the `def` keyword, to make the return type untyped. A method can also receive any number of arguments, which may not have their types explicitly declared. Java modifiers can be used normally, and if no visibility modifier is provided, the method is public.

Methods in Groovy always return some value. If no `return` statement is provided, the value evaluated in the last line executed will be returned. For instance, note that none of the following methods uses the `return` keyword.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/objectorientation/MethodsTest.groovy[tags=method_definition ,indent=0]
----
<1> Method with no return type declared and no parameter
<2> Method with explicit return type and no parameter
<3> Method with a parameter with no type defined
<4> Static method with a String parameter

==== Named arguments

Like constructors, normal methods can also be called with named arguments. They need to receive the parameters as a map. In the method body, the values can be accessed as in normal maps (`map.key`).

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/objectorientation/MethodsTest.groovy[tags=named_arguments ,indent=0]
----

==== Default arguments

Default arguments make parameters optional. If the argument is not supplied, the method assumes a default value.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/objectorientation/MethodsTest.groovy[tags=default_arguments ,indent=0]
----

Note that no mandatory parameter can be defined after a default parameter is present, only other default parameters.

==== Varargs

Groovy supports methods with a variable number of arguments. They are defined like this: `def foo(p1, ..., pn, T... args)`.
Here `foo` supports `n` arguments by default, but also an unspecified number of further arguments exceeding `n`.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/objectorientation/MethodsTest.groovy[tags=varargs_example,indent=0]
----

This example defines a method `foo`, that can take any number of arguments, including no arguments at all.
`args.length` will return the number of arguments given. Groovy allows `T[]` as a alternative notation to `T...`.
That means any method with an array as last parameter is seen by Groovy as a method that can take a variable number of arguments.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/objectorientation/MethodsTest.groovy[tags=varargs_array_notation,indent=0]
----

If a method with varargs is called with `null` as the vararg parameter, then the argument will be `null` and not an array of length one with `null` as the only element.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/objectorientation/MethodsTest.groovy[tags=varargs_null_parameter,indent=0]
----

If a varargs method is called with an array as an argument, then the argument will be that array instead of an array of length one containing the given array as the only element.

[source,groovy]
----
include::{projectdir}/src/spec/test/objectorientation/MethodsTest.groovy[tags=varargs_array_parameter,indent=0]
----

Another important point are varargs in combination with method overloading. In case of method overloading Groovy will select the most specific method.
For example if a method `foo` takes a varargs argument of type `T` and another method `foo` also takes one argument of type `T`, the second method is preferred.
