 * Class annotation used to assist in the creation of {@code Externalizable} classes.

 * that a class has {@code writeExternal()} and {@code readExternal()} methods,
 * implements the {@code Externalizable} interface and that each property (and optionally field) is not final
 * and, optionally for non-primitives, has a type which is either {@code Externalizable} or {@code Serializable}.
 * Properties or fields marked as {@code transient} are ignored.
 * This annotation is typically used in conjunction with the {@code @ExternalizeMethods} annotation but
 * most usually not directly but rather via {@code @AutoExternalizable} which is a shortcut for both annotations.
