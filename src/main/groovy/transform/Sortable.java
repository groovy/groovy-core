/**
 * A class annotation used to make a class Comparable by multiple Comparators.
 *
 * As an example, given this class:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Sortable} class Person {
 *     String first
 *     String last
 *     Integer born
 * }
 * </pre>
 * The generated Groovy class will:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>implement the {@code Comparable} interface</li>
 *     <li>have a {@code compareTo} method based on the {@code first},
 *     {@code last} and {@code born} properties (priority ordering will be according
 *     to the ordering of property definition, highest first, unless 'includes' is used; in which case,
 *     priority will be according to the order given in the includes list)</li>
 *     <li>have three {@code Comparator} methods named {@code comparatorByFirst},
 *     {@code comparatorByLast} and {@code comparatorByBorn}</li>
 * </ul>
 * The properties within the class must themselves be {@code Comparable} or {@code @Sortable}.
