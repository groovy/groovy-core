/**
 * Class annotation used to assist in the creation of {@code Externalizable} classes.
 * The {@code @AutoExternalize} annotation instructs the compiler to execute an
 * AST transformation which adds {@code writeExternal ( )} and {@code readExternal ( )} methods
 * to a class and adds {@code Externalizable} to the interfaces which the class implements.
 * The {@code writeExternal ( )} method writes each property (or field) for the class while the
 * {@code readExternal ( )} method will read each one back in the same order. Properties or fields
 * marked as {@code transient} are ignored.
 * <p>
 * Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * import groovy.transform.*
 * {@code @AutoExternalize}
 * class Person {*   String first, last
 *   List favItems
 *   Date since
 *}* </pre>
 * Which will create a class of the following form:
 * <pre>
 * class Person implements Externalizable {*   ...
 *   public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException {*     out.writeObject(first)
 *     out.writeObject(last)
 *     out.writeObject(favItems)
 *     out.writeObject(since)
 *}*
 *   public void readExternal(ObjectInput oin) {*     first = oin.readObject()
 *     last = oin.readObject()
 *     favItems = oin.readObject()
 *     since = oin.readObject()
 *}*   ...
 *}* </pre>
 * <p>
 * The {@code @AutoExternalize} transform is implemented as a combination of the {@code @ExternalizeMethods} and {@code @ExternalizeVerifier} transforms.
