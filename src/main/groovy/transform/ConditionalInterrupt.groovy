/**
 * Allows "interrupt-safe" executions of scripts by adding a custom check for interruption
 * into loops (for, while, ...) and at the start of closures and methods.
 * <p>
 * This is especially useful when executing foreign scripts that you do not have control over. Inject this
 * transformation into a script that you need to interrupt based on some custom criteria.
 * <p>
 * Annotating anything in a script will cause for loops, while loops, methods, and closures to make a
 * check against the specified closure. If the closure yields true (according to GroovyTruth), then the script
 * will throw an InterruptedException. The annotation by default applies to any classes defined in the script
 * as well. Annotated a class will cause (by default) all classes in the entire file ('Compilation Unit') to be
 * enhanced. You can fine tune what is enhanced using the annotation parameters.
 * <p>
 * The following is sample usage of the annotation:
 * <pre>
 * <code>@ConditionalInterrupt({ counter++> 10})</code>
 * import groovy.transform.ConditionalInterrupt
 *
 * counter = 0
 * def scriptMethod() {
 *      4.times {
 *          println 'executing script method...'
 *      }
 * }
 *
 * scriptMethod()
 * </pre>
 * Which results in the following code being generated (XXXXXX will be replaced with some runtime generated hashCode). Notice the checks and exceptions:
 * <pre>
 * public class script1291741477073 extends groovy.lang.Script {
 *   Object counter = 0
 *
 *   public java.lang.Object run() {
 *     counter = 0
 *   }
 *
 *   public java.lang.Object scriptMethod() {
 *     if (this.conditionalTransformXXXXXX$condition()) {
 *       throw new java.lang.InterruptedException('Execution interrupted. The following condition failed: { counter++> 10}')
 *     }
 *     4.times({
 *       if (this.conditionalTransformXXXXXX$condition()) {
 *         throw new java.lang.InterruptedException('Execution interrupted. The following condition failed: { counter++> 10}')
 *       }
 *       this.println('executing script method...')
 *     })
 *   }
 *
 *   private java.lang.Object conditionalTransformXXXXXX$condition() {
 *     counter++ > 10
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note that when you're annotating scripts, the variable scoping semantics are unchanged. Therefore, you must be
 * careful about the variable scope you're using. Make sure that variables you reference in the closure parameter
 * are in scope during script execution. The following example will throw a MissingPropertyException because
 * counter is not in scope for a class:
 * <pre>
 * import groovy.transform.ConditionalInterrupt
 *
 * def counter = 0
 * <code>@ConditionalInterrupt({ counter++> 10})</code>
 * class MyClass {
 *   def myMethod() {
 *     4.times {
 *       println 'executing script method...'
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * new MyClass().myMethod()
 * </pre>
 * Additional usage examples can be found in the unit test for this class.
