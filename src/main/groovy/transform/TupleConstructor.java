/**
 * Class annotation used to assist in the creation of tuple constructors in classes.
 * <p/>
 * It allows you to write classes in this shortened form:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @TupleConstructor} class Customer {
 *     String first, last
 *     int age
 *     Date since
 *     Collection favItems
 * }
 * def c1 = new Customer(first:'Tom', last:'Jones', age:21, since:new Date(), favItems:['Books', 'Games'])
 * def c2 = new Customer('Tom', 'Jones', 21, new Date(), ['Books', 'Games'])
 * def c3 = new Customer('Tom', 'Jones')
 * </pre>
 * The {@code @TupleConstructor} annotation instructs the compiler to execute an
 * AST transformation which adds the necessary constructor method to your class.
 * <p/>
 * A tuple constructor is created with a parameter for each property (and optionally field and
 * super properties).
 * A default value is provided (using Java's default values) for all parameters in the constructor.
 * Groovy's normal conventions then allows any number of parameters to be left off the end of the parameter list
 * including all of the parameters - giving a no-arg constructor which can be used with the map-style naming conventions.
 * <p/>
 * The order of parameters is given by the properties of any super classes with most super first
 * (if {@code includeSuperProperties} is set) followed by the properties of the class followed by the
 * by the fields of the class (if {@code includeFields} is set). Within each grouping the order
 * is as attributes appear within the respective class.
 * <p/>
 * Limitations: currently not designed to support inner classes.
