/**
 * Method annotation to make a method call synchronized for concurrency handling
 * with some useful baked-in conventions.
 * <p/>
 * {@code @Synchronized} is a safer variant of the <code>synchronized</code> method modifier.
 * The annotation can only be used on static and instance methods. It operates similarly to
 * the <code>synchronized</code> keyword, but it locks on different objects. When used with
 * an instance method, the <code>synchronized</code> keyword locks on <code>this</code>, but the annotation
 * locks on a (by default automatically generated) field named <code>$lock</code>.
 * If the field does not exist, it is created for you. If you annotate a static method,
 * the annotation locks on a static field named <code>$LOCK</code> instead.
 * <p/>
 * If you want, you can create these locks yourself.
 * The <code>$lock</code> and <code>$LOCK</code> fields will not be generated if you create
 * them yourself. You can also choose to lock on another field, by specifying its name as
 * parameter to the {@code @Synchronized} annotation. In this usage variant, the lock field
 * will not be created automatically, and you must explicitly create it yourself.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Rationale:</em> Locking on <code>this</code> or your own class object can have unfortunate side-effects,
 * as other code not under your control can lock on these objects as well, which can
 * cause race conditions and other nasty threading-related bugs.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Example usage:</em>
 * <pre>
 * class SynchronizedExample {
 *   private final myLock = new Object()
 *
 *   {@code @}Synchronized
 *   static void greet() {
 *     println "world"
 *   }
 *
 *   {@code @}Synchronized
 *   int answerToEverything() {
 *     return 42
 *   }
 *
 *   {@code @}Synchronized("myLock")
 *   void foo() {
 *     println "bar"
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * which becomes:
 * <pre>
 * class SynchronizedExample {
 *   private static final $LOCK = new Object[0]
 *   private final $lock = new Object[0]
 *   private final myLock = new Object()
 *
 *   static void greet() {
 *     synchronized($LOCK) {
 *       println "world"
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   int answerToEverything() {
 *     synchronized($lock) {
 *       return 42
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   void foo() {
 *     synchronized(myLock) {
 *       println "bar"
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * <em>Credits:</em> this annotation is inspired by the Project Lombok annotation of the
 * same name. The functionality has been kept similar to ease the learning
 * curve when swapping between these two tools.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Details:</em> If <code>$lock</code> and/or <code>$LOCK</code> are auto-generated, the fields are initialized
 * with an empty <code>Object[]</code> array, and not just a new <code>Object()</code> as many snippets using
 * this pattern tend to use. This is because a new <code>Object</code> is NOT serializable, but
 * a 0-size array is. Therefore, using {@code @Synchronized} will not prevent your
 * object from being serialized.
