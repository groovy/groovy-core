/**
 * The {@code @Builder} AST transformation is used to help write classes that can be created using <em>fluent</em> api calls.<!-- -->
 * The transform supports multiple building strategies to cover a range of cases and there are a number
 * of configuration options to customize the building process.
 *
 * In addition, a number of annotation attributes let you customise the building process. Not all annotation attributes
 * are supported by all strategies. See the individual strategy documentation for more details.
 * If you're an AST hacker, you can also define your own strategy class.
 *
 * The following strategies are bundled with Groovy:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link SimpleStrategy} for creating chained setters</li>
 *     <li>{@link ExternalStrategy} where you annotate an explicit builder class while leaving some buildee class being built untouched</li>
 *     <li>{@link DefaultStrategy} which creates a nested helper class for instance creation</li>
 *     <li>{@link InitializerStrategy} which creates a nested helper class for instance creation which when used with {@code @CompileStatic} allows type-safe object creation</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that Groovy provides other built-in mechanisms for easy creation of objects, e.g. the named-args constructor:
 * <pre>
 * new Person(firstName: "Robert", lastName: "Lewandowski", age: 21)
 * </pre>
 * or the with statement:
 * <pre>
 * new Person().with {
 *     firstName = "Robert"
 *     lastName = "Lewandowski"
 *     age = 21
 * }
 * </pre>
 * so you might not find value in using the builder transform at all. But if you need Java integration or in some cases improved type safety, the {@code @Builder} transform might prove very useful.
