/**
 * Class annotation used to assist in the creation of mutable classes.
 * <p/>
 * It allows you to write classes in this shortened form:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Canonical} class Customer {
 *     String first, last
 *     int age
 *     Date since
 *     Collection favItems = ['Food']
 *     def object 
 * }
 * def d = new Date()
 * def anyObject = new Object()
 * def c1 = new Customer(first:'Tom', last:'Jones', age:21, since:d, favItems:['Books', 'Games'], object: anyObject)
 * def c2 = new Customer('Tom', 'Jones', 21, d, ['Books', 'Games'], anyObject)
 * assert c1 == c2
 * </pre>
 *
 * If you set the autoDefaults flag to true, you don't need to provide all arguments in constructors calls,
 * in this case all properties not present are initialized to the default value, e.g.:
 * <pre>
 * def c3 = new Customer(last: 'Jones', age: 21)
 * def c4 = new Customer('Tom', 'Jones')
 * 
 * assert null == c3.since
 * assert 0 == c4.age
 * assert c3.favItems == ['Food'] && c4.favItems == ['Food']
 * </pre>
 *
 * The {@code @Canonical} annotation instructs the compiler to execute an
 * AST transformation which adds positional constructors,
 * equals, hashCode and a pretty print toString to your class. There are additional
 * annotations if you only need some of the functionality: {@code @EqualsAndHashCode},
 * {@code @ToString} and {@code @TupleConstructor}. In addition, you can add one of
 * the other annotations if you need to further customize the behavior of the
 * AST transformation.
 * <p/>
 * A class created in this way has the following characteristics:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A no-arg constructor is provided which allows you to set properties by name using Groovy's normal bean conventions.
 * <li>Tuple-style constructors are provided which allow you to set properties in the same order as they are defined.
 * <li>Default {@code equals}, {@code hashCode} and {@code toString} methods are provided based on the property values.
 * Though not normally required, you may write your own implementations of these methods. For {@code equals} and {@code hashCode},
 * if you do write your own method, it is up to you to obey the general contract for {@code equals} methods and supply
 * a corresponding matching {@code hashCode} method.
 * If you do provide one of these methods explicitly, the default implementation will be made available in a private
 * "underscore" variant which you can call. E.g., you could provide a (not very elegant) multi-line formatted
 * {@code toString} method for {@code Customer} above as follows:
 * <pre>
 *     String toString() {
 *        _toString().replaceAll(/\(/, '(\n\t').replaceAll(/\)/, '\n)').replaceAll(/, /, '\n\t')
 *    }
 * </pre>
 * If an "underscore" version of the respective method already exists, then no default implementation is provided.
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * If you want similar functionality to what this annotation provides but also require immutability, see the
 * {@code @Immutable} annotation.
 * <p/>
 * Limitations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * If you explicitly add your own constructors, then the transformation will not add any other constructor to the class.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
