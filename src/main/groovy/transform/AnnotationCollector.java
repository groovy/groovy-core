/**
 * The AnnotationCollector can be used to define aliases for groups of 
 * annotations. The Alias needs to be a class or annotation annotated with 
 * AnnotationCollector, otherwise nothing is required. The alias will be 
 * replaced on the AST level and will never appear in later. Any members of the 
 * class or annotation will be ignored, but could be used by a custom processor.
 * Annotation arguments are mapped to the aliased annotations
 * if existing. Should the default processor not be able to map one of the
 * arguments and error will be given. Is this not wished or if you want a 
 * different mapping a custom processor has to be used. There are two ways of 
 * using the alias. The first way is by providing the annotations as list/array:
 * <pre>
 *          import groovy.transform.*
 *          &#64;AnnotationCollector([ToString, EqualsAndHashCode, Immutable])
 *          &#64;interface Alias {}

 *          &#64;Alias(excludes=["a"])
 *          class Foo {
 *              Integer a, b
 *          }
 *          assert Foo.class.annotations.size()==3 
 *          assert new Foo(1,2).toString() == "Foo(2)"
 * </pre>
 * In the example above we have Alias as the alias annotation and an argument
 * excludes which will be mapped to ToString and EqualsAndHashCode. Immutable 
 * doesn't have excludes, thus nothing will be done there.<br>
 * The other way is to add annotations to the alias:
 * <pre>
 * import groovy.transform.*
 * &#64;ToString(excludes=["a"])
 * &#64;EqualsAndHashCode
 * &#64;Immutable
 * &#64;AnnotationCollector
 * &#64;interface Alias {}
 *
 * &#64;Alias
 * class Foo {
 *     Integer a, b
 * }
 * assert Foo.class.annotations.size()==3
 * assert new Foo(1,2).toString() == "Foo(2)"
 * </pre>
 * In the example above we have again Alias as the alias annotation, but
 * this time the argument is part of the alias. Instead of mapping excludes to
 * ToString as well as EqualsAndHashCode, only ToString will have the excludes.
 * Again the alias can have an argument excludes, which would overwrite the 
 * excludes given in from the definition and be mapped to ToString as well as
 * EqualsAndHashCode.
 * If both ways are combined, then the list overwrites annotation usage.
 * NOTE: The aliasing does not support aliasing of aliased annotations.
