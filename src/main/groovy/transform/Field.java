/**
 * Variable annotation used for changing the scope of a variable within a script from
 * being within the run method of the script to being at the class level for the script.
 * <p>
 * The annotated variable will become a private field of the script class.
 * The type of the field will be the same as the type of the variable. Example usage:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Field} List awe = [1, 2, 3]
 * def awesum() { awe.sum() }
 * assert awesum() == 6
 * </pre>
 * In this example, without the annotation, variable <code>awe</code> would be
 * a local script variable (technically speaking it will be a local variable within
 * the <code>run</code> method of the script class). Such a local variable would
 * not be visible inside the <code>awesum</code> method. With the annotation,
 * <code>awe</code> becomes a private List field in the script class and is
 * visible within the <code>awesum</code> method.
