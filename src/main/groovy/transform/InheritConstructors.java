/**
 * Class annotation to make constructors from a super class available in a sub class.
 * <p>
 * {@code @InheritConstructors} saves you typing some boilerplate code.
 * <p>
 * <em>Example usage:</em>
 * <pre>
 * class Person {
 *     String first, last
 *     Person(String first, String last) {
 *         this.first = first
 *         this.last = last.toUpperCase()
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * {@code @InheritConstructors}
 * class PersonAge extends Person {
 *     int age
 * }
 *
 * def js = new PersonAge('John', 'Smith')
 * js.age = 25
 * println "$js.last, $js.first is $js.age years old"
 * // => SMITH, John is 25 years old
 * </pre>
 * for this case, the <code>PersonAge</code> class will be
 * equivalent to the following code:
 * <pre>
 * class PersonAge extends Person {
 *     PersonAge(String first, String last) {
 *         super(first, last)
 *     }
 *     int age
 * }
 * </pre>
 * You may add additional constructors in addition to inherited ones.
 * If the argument types of a supplied constructor exactly match those
 * of a parent constructor, then that constructor won't be inherited.
 * <p>
 * <em>Style note:</em> Don't go overboard using this annotation.
 * Typical Groovy style is to use named-arg constructors when possible.
 * This is easy to do for Groovy objects or any objects following JavaBean
 * conventions. In other cases, inheriting the constructors may be useful.
 * However, sub-classes often introduce new properties and these are often best
 * set in a constructor; especially if that matches the style adopted
 * in parent classes. So, even for the example above, it may have been
 * better style to define an explicit constructor for <code>PersonAge</code>
 * that also set the <code>age</code> property. Sometimes, consistent
 * style is much more important than saving a few keystrokes.
 * <p>
 * As another example, this:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @InheritConstructors} class CustomException extends RuntimeException { }
 * </pre>
 * is equivalent to this:
 * <pre>
 * class CustomException extends RuntimeException {
 *     CustomException() {
 *         super()
 *     }
 *     CustomException(String message) {
 *         super(message)
 *     }
 *     CustomException(String message, Throwable cause) {
 *         super(message, cause)
 *     }
 *     CustomException(Throwable cause) {
 *         super(cause)
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <em>Advanced note:</em>If you create Groovy constructors with optional
 * arguments this leads to multiple constructors created in the byte code.
 * The expansion to multiple constructors occurs in a later phase to
 * this AST transformation. This means that you can't override (i.e. not
 * inherit) the constructors with signatures that Groovy adds later.
 * If you get it wrong you will get a compile-time error about the duplication.
 * </p>
