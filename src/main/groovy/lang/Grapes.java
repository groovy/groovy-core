/**
 * Sometimes we will need more than one grab per class, but we can only add
 * one annotation type per annotatable node.  This class allows for multiple
 * grabs to be added.
 * <p/>
 * For example:
 * <p/>
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Grapes([@Grab(module='m1'), @Grab(module='m2')])}
 * class AnnotatedClass { ... }
 * </pre>
 * <p/>
 * You can override an implicit transitive dependency by providing an explicit one.
 * E.g. htmlunit 2.6 normally uses xerces 2.9.1 but you can get 2.9.0 as follows:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Grapes}([
 *     {@code @Grab}('net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit:2.6'),
 *     {@code @Grab}('xerces#xercesImpl;2.9.0')
 * ])
 * </pre>
 * Obviously, only do this if you understand the consequences.
 * <p/>
 * You can also remove transitive dependencies altogether (provided you
 * know you don't need them) using {@code @GrabExclude}.
 * For example, here is how we would not grab the {@code logkit} and
 * {@code avalon-framework} transitive dependencies for Apache POI:
 * <pre>
 * {@code @Grapes}([
 *   {@code @Grab}("org.apache.poi#poi;3.5-beta6"),
 *   {@code @GrabExclude}("logkit:logkit"),
 *   {@code @GrabExclude}("avalon-framework#avalon-framework")
 * ])
 * import org.apache.poi.hssf.util.CellReference
 * assert new CellReference(0, 0, false, false).formatAsString() == 'A1'
 * assert new CellReference(1, 3).formatAsString() == '$D$2'
 * </pre>
 * It is also sometimes also useful to use {@code @GrabConfig} to further adjust how dependencies
 * are grabbed. See {@code @GrabConfig} for further information.
