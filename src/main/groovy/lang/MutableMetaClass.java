 * An interface that defines methods that implementers of mutable Meta classes should specify. It provides operations to perform mutations
 * on the MetaClass instance.
 * <p/>
 * Whether a MetaClass allows mutation is up to the MetaClass itself and considerations of Thread safety
 * need to be taken into account when making a MetaClass mutable
 * <p/>
 * The default implementation allows mutation of MetaClass instances before initialisation (before the initialize() method is called)
 * but not after, thus ensuring Thread safety once a MetaClass has been constructed and placed in the registry
