/**
 * This class defines new groovy methods which appear on normal JDK
 * classes related to process management.
 * <p>
 * Static methods are used with the first parameter being the destination class,
 * i.e. <code>public static String reverse(String self)</code>
 * provides a <code>reverse()</code> method for <code>String</code>.
 * <p>
 * NOTE: While this class contains many 'public' static methods, it is
 * primarily regarded as an internal class (its internal package name
 * suggests this also). We value backwards compatibility of these
 * methods when used within Groovy but value less backwards compatibility
 * at the Java method call level. I.e. future versions of Groovy may
 * remove or move a method call in this file but would normally
 * aim to keep the method available from within Groovy.
